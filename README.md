## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the app on your local machine or any cloud platform.

1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```python
bash
git clone https://github.com/YASsMeN1997/LLMS_AI_Test.git
```

2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

```python
bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

```python
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a .env File

The .env file should contain your API key and other environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following content:

```python
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY = your_openai_api_key_here
SMTP_SERVER = smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT = 587
SENDER_EMAIL = your_email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD = your_email_password_here
ENDPOINT = your_Deployment_Endpoint
```

5. Ensure the assets Folder Exists

Make sure you have an assets folder in the root directory of your project to store the uploaded images. If the folder doesn't exist, create it:

```python
bash
mkdir assets
```

## Usage

1. **Run the App**

After setting up the project, run the app.py file to start the Gradio interface.

```python
bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a local Gradio interface in your browser where you can interact with the app.

2. **Input Fields**

- Car Description: Enter the description of the car.
- Car Image: Upload an image of the car.
- Email Address: Enter the email where the car details will be sent.

3. **Submit Data**
Click on the "Send Car Details" button to submit the car description, image, and email. The app will process the car description, generate the car details in JSON format, and send an email to the provided email address with the car details and the image attached.

---


## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The user provides the car description, image, and email.
   
2. **Car Description Parsing**:
   - The app uses OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini model to process the car description and generate a structured JSON object containing the car details.

3. **Email Sending**:
   - The car details and the image are sent via email to the user.

4. **Image Upload**:
   - The uploaded image is saved in the assets folder on the server.
